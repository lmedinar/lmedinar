Hey! I'm Luis Medina, almost graduating from Bionics. 
I'm interested in bio-inspired algoritmhs and all kind of simulations.
I have some experience programming in C, C++, Python, Octave/MATLAB, and I'd like to learn the Crystal language soon.
I programmed games as a hobby for some time, so that's another interest I may persue in the future.
